    h3 Homogeneous broadening in qw diodes
    h4 Homogeneous and inhomogeneous effects
    | Both effects normally coexist in the spectra, but under specific conditions they can also be observed
    | separately.
    | A classic example, where homogeneous lifetime broadening determines the spectral shape is the
    | impact pressure broadening in gases. At low pressures, the velocity distribution of atoms produces Doppler
    | shifts to the photons and the emission spectrum has Gaussian shape following the thermal velocity distribution
    | of the emitting gas atoms. Since the emitters are not identical (have Gaussian distribution), Doppler effect produces
    | inhomogeneous broadening.
    | However, when the pressure is increased the gas atoms collide more frequently with each other. Collisions interrupt
    | the photonic relaxation processes in the emission (excitation process in optical absorption).
    | This sets on the impact lifetime broadening effect. With increasing pressure, the spectral shape first follows a
    | Voigt function, a convolution between the original inhomogeneous Gaussian and the homogeneous, Lorentzian impact
    | broadened shape. At somewhat higher pressures the broadening becomes purely Lorentzian (homogeneous) in shape.
    h4 Homogeneous shape
    | Homogeneous shape describes the relaxation in a population of mutually independent and identical (=homogeneous)
    | emitters. Population members are identical if they have equal transition energies and equal radiation (relaxation)
    | probabilities.
    br
    | Assuming \(N\) is the number of such population members, the relaxation rate and emission behaviour can be
    | expressed as:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe1}
    | -dN/dt=N\cdot p(t)=N\cdot(A+B\cdot t+C\cdot t^2...),
    | \end{equation}
    | where \(p(t)\) is the relaxation probability in unit time, and is then expressed as a polynomial expansion.
    | Separating the variables we have:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe2}
    | -dN/N=A\cdot dt +(B\cdot t+C\cdot t^2+...)\cdot dt,
    | \end{equation}
    | where, polynomial components grouped inside the parenthetis are problematic, while a zero instance is needed for the time
    | variable and the elapsed time recorded throughout the entire relaxation process. For these components, the homogeneity assumption
    | requires that all population members start relaxing simultaneously and individually record the elapsed time.
    | In other words in a memoryless relaxation process (with
    -var Markov_urli="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property"
    a(href=Markov_urli target="_blank")    \(Markov\, Property\)
    |   ) we have: \(B=C=D.....=0\), meaning the relaxation probability, \(p(t)\) is a constant in time and the
    | bookkeeping for elapsed time is not required for it. Assuming \(N=N_{0}\) at \(t=t_{0}\), we get after integration:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe3}
    | ln(N)=-A\cdot (t-t_{0}) + ln(N_{0}),
    | \end{equation}
    | where \(ln(N_{0})\) is a constant of integration. Setting: \(A=1/\tau\) , results into a

    | \label{HomogDiffe4}
    | N(t)=N_{0}\cdot e^{-t/\tau},
    | \end{equation}
    | where \(\tau\) is the relaxation and \(t_{0}\) is taken as \(0\).
    br
    | Normally, more than one physical phenomenon participates in the relaxation. Without no other mechanisms, the
    | spontaneous emission (stimulated emission caused by zero point energy fluctuations) determines the relaxation rate.
    | With several independent mechanisms the resulting relaxation time is obtained as:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe5}
    | 1/\tau_{r}= 1/\tau_{1}+1/\tau_{2}+.... ~,
    | \end{equation}
    | In the former example case about impact pressure broadening, \(\tau_{1}\) could equal the spontaneous emission lifetime
    | and \(\tau_{2}\) the atomic collision lifetime.

    | \end{equation}
    | where \(\Delta E\) is the photon energy deviation from the emission line center. This function integrates to
    | unity (\(\Delta E: -\infty \rightarrow +\infty\)) and if it originates from spontaneous emission, the line shape is known as

    h4 Does homogeneous broadening always produce Lorentzian line shapes?
    | The above derivation seems to suggest that homogeneously broadened lines should always have Lorentzian shapes,
    | but at least one contradicting example is known to exist in the lifetime broadening of qw-LED's.
    | There, the physical situation extensively resembles that of the impact pressure broadening in gases,
    | where the photon emission process is interrupted by the gas atom collisions.
    br
    | In quantum well diodes, both the electron and the hole collisions are possible as the relaxation incidents.
    | On the other hand, if the electron hole pair is examined as a single entity (a bound exciton) before the
    | recombination, one ends up to a single relaxation event, which is generally described by combining the
    | electron and hole relaxation times according to Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe5}). One then obtains the spectrum from
    | Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe6}), which poorly fits the observed quantum well diode spectra (below, overlaps the observed
    | spectra on less than one intensity decade). The high density of current injected charge carriers in the quantum
    | well and the high electric field in the pn-junction area effectively screen the exciton formation and eliminate
    | related spectral peaks. In optically excited photo luminescent spectra, pn-junction field
    | can be eliminated and correspondingly the PL-emission often shows more spectral details.

    | With increasing diode currents, homogeneous lifetime broadening takes over and the spectrum spreads more and more
    | on the low energy side.

    | If we keep the 'before recombination defined exciton entity' and want to improve the spectral fitting from the
    | Lorentzian shape above, one possibility is to abandon the Markov property in the eh-pair relaxation, which
    | would complicate the physical models significantly.
    br
    | Fortunately, a much simpler solution is available. Keeping the simplest possible relaxation models of
    | Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe4}) we have Lorentzian broadening for all energy states in the conduction and valence
    | bands. If k-vector conservation is not included in the recombination, it is necessary to

    |       the electron and hole Lorentzians in order to obtain the resulting spectrum. This results into a new but
    | broader Lorentzian shape with identical \(\tau_{r}\) value as was obtained earlier through the 'exciton entity model'
    | and summing the electron and hole relaxation times in Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe5}). However, the k-vector (impulse)
    | of the emitted photon is small. Therefore, it is generally considered that k-vector conservation (\(k_{e}=k_{h}\))
    | should be included in the e-h recombination. This couples the electron and hole energy broadenings together and
    | the resulting spectrum is instead of convolution a

    | Two sequential convolution integrals are necessary to calculate the resulting spectra,

    | optimize the convolution calculi, which is possible by applying the convolution theorem in the Fourier
    | transformation. The two convolved functions are first Fourier transformed. After multiplying the obtained
    | transforms, the spectral convolution is finally obtained after an inverse Fourier transformation.
