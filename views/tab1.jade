  | save data either to server (upload) or locally (download).
  | By default, download takes place into a folder defined by your browser settings.
  br
  | Mozilla-FF provides methods to safety check and inspect the file contents before the saving.
  br
  | For that, a basic text editor without scripting possibility is recommended. MS-Notepad is OK, but does
  br
  | not show the contents correctly, while it requires CR,LF characters to start a new line.
  br
  | Google Chrome in turn provides possibility to edit the filename and select the download folder.
  br
  | Internet Explorer and MS-Edge browsers support HTML5 File Apis through blob objects (binary large object)
  br
  | and file drag and drop. As these are not applied here (this application uses local saving to text files),
  br
  | the MS-browsers are not recommend, if you want local storage. see also http://caniuse.com/#search=file%20api
