    h3 Homogeneous broadening in qw diodes
    h4 Homogeneous and inhomogeneous effects
    | Both effects normally coexist in the spectra, but under specific conditions they can also be observed
    | separately.
    | A classic example, where homogeneous lifetime broadening determines the spectral shape is the
    | impact pressure broadening in gases. At low pressures, the velocity distribution of atoms produces Doppler
    | shifts to the photons and the emission spectrum has Gaussian shape following the thermal velocity distribution
    | of the emitting gas atoms. Since the emitters are not identical (have Gaussian distribution), Doppler effect produces
    | inhomogeneous broadening.
    | However, when the pressure is increased the gas atoms collide more frequently with each other. Collisions interrupt
    | the photonic relaxation processes in the emission (excitation process in optical absorption).
    | This sets on the impact lifetime broadening effect. With increasing pressure, the spectral shape first follows a
    | Voigt function, a convolution between the original inhomogeneous Gaussian and the homogeneous, Lorentzian impact
    | broadened shape. At somewhat higher pressures the broadening becomes purely Lorentzian (homogeneous) in shape.
    h4 Homogeneous shape
    | Homogeneous shape describes the relaxation in a population of mutually identical (=homogeneous) emitters. Emitters
    | are identical if they have equal transition energies and equal radiation probabilities.
    br
    | Assuming \(N\) is the number of members in such a population, the relaxation rate (and the emission intensity) can be
    | developed into a time function using a Taylor expansion:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe1}
    | -dN/dt=N\cdot(A+B\cdot t+C\cdot t^2...),
    | \end{equation}
    | Separating the variables we get:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe2}
    | -dN/N=A\cdot dt +(B\cdot t+C\cdot t^2+...)\cdot dt,
    | \end{equation}
    | In this equation, the terms inside parenthetis are problematic, because a zero time instance has to be set and
    | remembered throughout the entire relaxation. For them, the homogeneity assumption means that all members have identical
    | relaxation probabilities all the time in the process requiring all members start relaxing simultaneously and
    | remember their elapsed time from the zero instance. In other words for a memoryless relaxation process (with
    -var Markov_urli="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property"
    a(href=Markov_urli target="_blank")    Markov Property
    |    ), we have \(B=C=D.....=0\). Assuming \(N=N_{0}\) at \(t=0\), we get after integration:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe3}
    | ln(N)=-A\cdot t + ln(N_{0}),
    | \end{equation}
    | where \(ln(N_{0})\) is a constant of integration. Setting: \(A=1/\tau\) , results in:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe4}
    | N(t)=N_{0}\cdot e^{-t/\tau},
    | \end{equation}
    | where \(\tau\) is called the relaxation time in the process. Normally, more than one phenomenon produces the
    | relaxation. Without all other mechanisms, spontaneous emission (stimulated by zero point energy fluctuations)
    | determines the relaxation time. With several independent mechanisms the resulting relaxation time is obtaineda as:
    | \begin{equation}
    | \label{HomogDiffe5}
    | 1/\tau_{r}= 1/\tau_{1}+1/\tau_{2}+.... ~,
    | \end{equation}
    | In the above impact pressure broadening example \(\tau_{1}\) would equal the spontaneous emission lifetime and
    | \(\tau_{2}\) the atomic collision lifetime.

    h4 Does homogeneous broadening always produce Lorentzian line shapes?
    | The above derivation suggests that homogeneously broadened lines should always have Lorentzian shapes.
    | However, at least one contradicting case is known to exist in the lifetime broadening of qw-LED's, where the physical
    | situation extensively resembles that of the impact pressure broadening, but in stead of plain gas atom collisions,
    | the emission process can be interrupted by two incidents, either by the electron or the hole relaxation.
    | If the electron hole pair, before the recombination and photon emission, is examined as a single entity
    | (a bound exciton), one ends up summing the electron and hole relaxation times according to Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe5})
    | and gets the spectrum from Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe6}), which poorly fits the observed quantum well diode spectra
    | (below, overlaps less than one intensity decade with best fitting \(\tau_{r}\)=65fs). The high density of charge
    | carriers injected into the qw through the diode currend and the high electric field in the pn-junction area
    | effectively eliminate all exciton related peaks. In optically excited photo luminescent spectra, pn-junction field
    | can be eliminated and correspondingly the PL-emission often shows more spectral details.

        |  With a low current value (0.5mA), Urbach tail like spectrum is recorded (Eu=10.5meV, Eg=1.53eV).
        br
        | With larger currents lifetime broadening takes over and spreads the spectra more and more below the bandgap.
    | If we keep the 'before recombination defined exciton entity' model and want to improve the spectral fitting, one
    | possibility is to abandon the Markov property in the eh-pair relaxation. This complicates the physical models
    | significantly. Fortunately, a much simpler solution is available. Keeping the simplest possible electron and hole relaxation
    | model of Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe4}) we have Lorentzian broadenings for all energy states in the conduction and valence bands.
    | During the electron-hole pair recombination process it is possible examine two alternative possibilities:
    | If k-vector is not conserved in the process it is necessary to convolve the electron and hole Lorentzians. This
    | results into a broader Lorentzian shape and is identical with the above 'exciton entity model' obtained by summing the
    | electron and hole relaxation times using Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe5}). However, the k-vector (impulse) of the emitted
    | photon is small. Therefore, it is generally considered that k-vector is conserved in the recombination
    | (\(k_{e}=k_{h}\)). This couples the electron and hole energy broadenings together and the resulting spectrum is
    | instead of convolution a

    h4 Calculation of homogeneous qw-spectra
    | Homogeneous broadening can be identified by convolving the inhomogeneously broadened spectra (in inhomogeneous menu:
    | Urbach, Gaussian or Sech) with the homogeneous line shapes either according to Eq. (\ref{HomogDiffe6}) or Eq.
    | (\ref{DLorentz}) (in the homogeneous menu). The combination of Lorentzian and Gaussian results into Voigt profile,
    | which is therefore also available here for the fitting of experimental spectra. Fortunately

    | By changing the JDOS in the model, it is possible to calculate homogeneous broadening graphs for bulk materials as well.
    | However, the experimental observation of homogeneously broadened bulk material PL-spectra is utterly difficult
    | because the required high charge carrier densities cannot be achieved in large volumes on bulk materials without
    | any lateral charge carrier confinements.
