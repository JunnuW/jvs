    | in high quality GaAs at 300K temperature).
    | The temperature dependent part in \(E_{u}\) has been associated to phonon created disorder and
    | the exponential shape explained by the Gaussian occurence probability of local potential pit depth energies
    | created by the disorder. The phonon created disorder is not permanent or static, but when compared against the photon

    | Urbach tail therefore behaves like spatial (i.e. inhomogeneous) variations in the material band gap energy
    | obeying Gaussian occurence probability.

    h4(style="color:Green") Inhomogeneous broadening in quantum well diodes
    |     At low excitation conditions, similar exponential band gap tail, spanning several intensity decades
    | can be observed also in the emission spectrum of qw LED's. At small diode currents this tail behaves
    | as the broadening minimum and is by shape akin with the Urbach tail, originating from spatial
    | variations in the quantum well dimensions and materials. At low current levels, on laterally small devices,
    | this spectral tail loses its current dependency, but shows some sensitivity on diode's temperature.
