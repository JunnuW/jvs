    h2 Login or not login?
    | This site has (some) cloud based storage space for user files and messages. In order to avoid abuse
    | (robots or malicious users), all the space is reserved for logged in users only. The email address required
    | during signup is merely for password recovery, if forgotten. It will not be sold or used to pollute your mailbox
    | with commercial messages. If you want to be sure, and do not need the password recovery option, you can signup with
    | an imaginary email address. During signup, the user password will be hashed before saving and without a real email
    | address there is no easy way to recover it from the server. Passive login data will be regularly deleted from the server.
