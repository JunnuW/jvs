        h3 Motivation and Purpose:
        p
        | Because of the high efficiency, LED's and laser diodes have gained popularity in many applications.
        | To reach the high efficiencies LED's are constructed with one or more quantum wells in the semiconductor
        | diode's pn-diode junction area. The purpose of the quantum well is to collect the electric charge carriers to a
        | tightly restricted area, where the increased density dramatically increases the recombination probability
        | between the electrons and holes. Each recombining pair may produce an emitted photon and thereby
        | contribute to the emission of light from the diode. To describe the conversion of electric power into photon flux,
        | in addition to power efficiency, we need to evaluate also the
        em  wavelength
        |   and
        em  the broadening mechanisms.
        br
        br
        b
          i  The emission wavelength
        |   (spectral color) is determined by the semiconductor material bandgap, in combination
        |with the dimensions (depth and width) of the included quantum well. These three parameters have been tailored during the
        |material deposition processes during the fabrication. However, for the
        b   other spectral details
        |   we also need to understand the involved
        b   broadening phenomena.
        |   In LED's (also in semiconductor lasers below lazing threshold), the emission spectra are rather broad, at least
        | significantly broader than calculated before the spectral broadening
        |mechanisms are accounted for. A correct spectral broadening model is required also for semiconductor laser modelling
        |to calculate the shape of the laser gain function.
        br
        br
        |Several spectral broadening functions are available and many have also been proposed for LED calculations.
        |This site examines three of them. Optical broadening mechanisms are often categorized to be either
        b   inhomogeneous
        |   or
        b   homogeneous.
        |   In LED's, inhomogeneous broadening arises from local fluctuations in material properties and
        |quantum well dimensions. These typically have Gaussian occurrence probability, which directly transforms to gaussian
        |spectral shapes. This kind of broadening is easily observed at low excitation levels (small diode currents), and the
        |width of the spectrum reveals the quality of materials and processes been used.
        |At higher intensities (larger diode currents), the density of carriers in the quantum wells increases and through
        |collision with each other significantly reduce the lifetime of exitons (electron-hole pairs).
        |This results into
        b    lifetime broadening,
        | which is a homogeneous process, since the locally close electrons are indistinguishable from each other
        | as well as the closely located holes are indistinguishable from each other.
        | Therefore, homogeneous spectral broadening takes over in LED's at high light intensities.
        h3 Applied methods:
        p
        |In order to focus on writing and modelling, the number of new drawings remains minimal, which possibly decreases readability, but is
        |compensated by links to available graphs elsewhere on the web. Another topic is the mathematical formulas and equations,
        |that will be more or less unavoidable. For adding equations on HTML5 pages, several options are available claiming
        |to support equally all browsers.

        br
        | \begin{align}
        | \label{LorentzianLB}
        | L_{t}(\Delta E)=&\frac{\tau_{r}/(\pi\hbar)}{1+\tau_{r}^{2}\Delta E^{2}/\hbar^{2}}\\
        | \tau_{r}=&\frac{\tau_{e}\tau_{h}}{\tau_{e}+\tau_{h}}\label{TauR}\

        br
        | \begin{align}
        |\Delta E_{e}=&\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{e}}[(k_{e}+\Delta k_{e})^{2}-k_{e}^{2}]\label{Deltak1}\\
        |\Delta E_{h}=&\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{h}}[(k_{h}+\Delta k_{h})^{2}-k_{h}^{2}]\label{Deltak2}\\
        |\Delta E=&\Delta E_{e}+\Delta E_{h}\label{totdE2}\
        |\end{align}
        |Line broadening permits transitions also in the bandgap, where \(\Delta E_{e}\) and \(\Delta E_{h}\) have
        |negative values, which requires imaginary \( \Delta k \) values.
        | This means that, for exciton \((E_{e},E_{h})\), broadening energy \(\Delta E\) is possible only with these
        | simultaneous \(\Delta E_{e}\) and \(\Delta E_{h}\) values. Their probability densities are:
        |\begin{align}
        |p_{e}(\Delta E_{e})=&\frac{\tau_{be}/(\pi\hbar)}{1+\tau_{be}^{2}\Delta E^{2}/\hbar^{2}}\label{Pe}\\
        |p_{h}(\Delta E_{h})=&\frac{\tau_{bh}/(\pi\hbar)}{1+\tau_{bh}^{2}\Delta E^{2}/\hbar^{2}}\label{Ph}\
        |\end{align}
        |where
        |\begin{equation}
        |\tau_{be}=\frac{\tau_{e}m_{h}}{m_{h}+m_{e}} \quad\textrm{and}\quad\tau_{bh}=\frac{\tau_{h}m_{e}}{m_{h}+m_{e}}
        |\label{Reducedtau}
        |\end{equation}
        |If the allowed wave vector mismatch ($\Delta k_{e}-\Delta k_{h}$) is small in the recombination, and the intraband scattering processes at $E_{e}$ and $E_{h}$ are independent, as was assumed also with Eqs. (\ref{LorentzianLB}) and (\ref{TauR}), the corresponding homogeneous line shape is now obtained as the normalized product of the two above probability densities:
        |\begin{equation}
        |L_{t}(\Delta E)= \frac{(\tau_{be}+\tau_{bh})/(\pi\hbar)}{1+\tau_{be}^{2}\Delta E^{2}/\hbar^{2}}\times\frac{1}{1+\tau_{bh}^{2}\Delta E^{2}/\hbar^{2}}\label{DLorentz}~,
        |\end{equation}
        |or if expressed as a difference of two Lorentzians \cite{Lin1}:
        |\begin{align}\nonumber
        |L_{t}(\Delta E)=\frac{1}{\pi\hbar\cdot(\tau_{bh}-\tau_{be})}
        |\times \Big(\frac{\tau_{bh}^{2}}{1+\tau_{bh}^{2}\Delta E^{2}/\hbar^{2}}-
        |\frac{\tau_{be}^{2}}{1+\tau_{be}^{2}\Delta E^{2}/\hbar^{2}}\Big)\label{DLorentz2}~,
        |\end{align}
        |Starting from Fermi's golden rule, spontaneous interband emission rate without Coulomb interactions has been
        |expressed as: \cite{Coldren1,Christen1}
        |\begin{align}\nonumber
        |R_{sp}(E)=\frac{ne^{2}}{\epsilon_{0}\hbar^{2}\pi c^3m_{0}^2}E|M_{T}|^2\rho_{r}(E)f_{c}(E)
        |\times(1-f_{v}(E))\label{Spectrum1}\
        |\end{align}
        |Here \(|M_{T}|^{2}\) is the transition matrix element, \(\rho_{r}\) the JDOS, and \(f_{c}\) and \(f_{v}\)
        |are the Fermi functions for the conduction band (CB) electrons and valence band (VB) holes, respectively.
        |To evaluate spectral distributions with Coulomb interactions and broadening effects, Eq. (\ref{Spectrum1})
        |is multiplied with exciton continuum enhancement \(S(\epsilon)\), and convolved with line broadening function
        |\(L_{t}(E)\). Approximating \(f_{c}\times (1-f_{v})\) with Boltzmann distribution we get the emitted spectra from:
        |\begin{align}\nonumber
        |R_{sp}(E)\propto\int_0^\infty |M_{T}|^2 \epsilon\rho_{r}(\epsilon)S(\epsilon)exp(-\epsilon/k_{B}T)\\
        |\times L_{t}(E-\epsilon)\mathrm{d}\epsilon\label{Spectrum2}\ ~,
        |\end{align}
        br
        | where \(k_{B}\) is the Boltzmann coefficient.
        | the exciton true continuum is:
        | \begin{align}
        | S_{s}(E)=&\pi\alpha\frac{e^{\pi\alpha}}{sinh(\pi\alpha)}\label{BulkEnh1}\\
        | \alpha=&\sqrt{\frac{E_{b}}{E-E_{g}}}\label{BulkEnh2}\
        | \end{align}
        | Eq. (\ref{BulkEnh2}) has a pole at \(E_{g}\) coinciding with zero in JDOS (\(\rho_{r}\) in
        | Eq. (\ref{Spectrum2})), but the combination with parabolic band edge, (\(\rho_{r}\propto \sqrt{E-E{g}}\))
        | leads to finite spectral power densities enabling the numerical integration of Eq. (\ref{Spectrum2}).
        | polarizations are observable. The corresponding enhancement factors are \cite{Shinada}:
        | \begin{align}
        | S_{TE}(E)=&\frac{e^{\pi\alpha}}{cosh(\pi\alpha)}\label{QwEnh1}\\
        | S_{TM}(E)=&(1+4\alpha^{2})\frac{e^{\pi\alpha}}{cosh(\pi\alpha)}\label{QwEnh2}\ ~,
        | \end{align}
        | where \(\alpha\) is given in Eq. (\ref{BulkEnh2}) and \(E_{g}\) is the bandgap energy in the quantum well
